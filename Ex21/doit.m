% The story: 
% A study has been conducted at the institute for elderly research in order to investigate the
% efficiency of a new drug for neuro enhancement. The achieved scores of the participants (n=100)
% for a memory test before and after multi-week administration of the drug are included in the file
% Ex21 NeuroEnhancement.mat (column 1: person ID, column 2: before, column 3: after). Did the
% drug have a performance-enhancing effect on the memory of elderly people? Justify the choice of the
% appropriate statistical test, analyse the data at a level of significance of alpha = 0:01 and interpret the
% result.
