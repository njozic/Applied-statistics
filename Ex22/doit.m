% The story: 
% Along the A10 highway at Groedig as well as in Golling a device measures the daily pollution
% with fine particles. Analyse if the pollution with fine particles at both locations during the year
% was equal or significantly different (Ex22 FineParticles.mat, column 1: Groedig, column 2: Golling).
% Justify the choice of the appropriate statistical test and interpret the results (alpha = [0.05; 0.01]).
